      "### Step 1: Analyzing the Results\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Shape Parameter (\\(\\beta\\))**: \n",
      "   - A shape parameter of \\(8.15\\) indicates a significantly increasing failure rate over time. This suggests that the likelihood of failure increases sharply as the time progresses, which is common in mechanical systems subjected to wear and tear.\n",

      "2. **Scale Parameter (\\(\\eta\\))**: \n",
      "   - The scale parameter of \\(151.26\\) indicates the characteristic life, meaning that approximately \\(63.2\\%\\) of the items are expected to fail by this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Location Parameter (\\(t_0\\))**: \n",
      "   - A location parameter of \\(0\\) means that the failure distribution starts from the origin, indicating that time starts from when the item is put into service.\n",

      "Now, let's compare these obtained parameters with the provided choices:\n",

      "Given the significantly higher shape parameter (\\(\\beta \\approx 8.15\\)), which is much greater than any of the options provided, none of the choices accurately reflect the fitted parameters from the data.\n",

      "Since the parameters obtained from the data fitting do not match any of the provided choices, the best fit Weibull parameters based on the analysis are:\n",
