To run our code, simply run `run.ipynb`. Source code is in the folder `src`.
You'll need the env var `OPENAI_API_KEY` set up. To do so you can simply create a `.env` file with your env variable in it.

/!\ If you want to use the python agent (part of the code), make sure you are using a virtual environment with folder name ".venv".
