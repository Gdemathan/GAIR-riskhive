        "entry": "**Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)**: Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a deductive failure analysis technique used to identify the root causes of a system failure by modeling failure propagation using logic gates. The TOP event represents the system failure, which is decomposed into contributing events through AND and OR gates. Formulas include: System Failure Probability (for independent events): `P_system = 1 - Π(1 - P_i)`, System Failure Probability (for series systems): `P_system = ΠP_i`, System Failure Probability (for parallel systems): `P_system = 1 - Π(1 - P_i)`. Example: For a system with two components (failure probabilities 0.1 and 0.2), the failure probability for a parallel configuration is: `P_system = 1 - (1 - 0.1)(1 - 0.2) = 0.28`."

It helps prioritize risks based on severity, occurrence, and detection. Formulas include: Risk Priority Number (RPN): `RPN = S × O × D`, Criticality Index (CI): `CI = λ × t × β`. Example: For Severity (S) = 8, Occurrence (O) = 5, and Detection (D) = 4, `RPN = 8 × 5 × 4 = 160`."

It is critical in redundant systems where multiple failures can compromise reliability. Formulas include: Beta Factor Model: `P_CMF = β × P_individual`, Miller’s Multiplicity Factor: `P_CMF = 1 - (1 - P_individual)^n`. Example: For two components (failure probability = 0.01) and a beta factor of 0.2, `P_CMF = 0.2 × 0.01 = 0.002`."
